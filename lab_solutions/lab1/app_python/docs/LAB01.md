# LAB01 - FastAPI Selection

## Framework Selection
**FastAPI** has been chosen for this lab because it provides automatic documentation, excellent performance, and modern API while staying lightweight for a simple service.

### Quick Comparison
| Framework | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FastAPI | Fast, async-ready, built-in docs, type hints | Slightly more setup than Flask |
| Flask | Minimal, easy to learn | No built-in docs, fewer batteries |
| Django | Full-featured, ORM included | Heavy for a small API |
